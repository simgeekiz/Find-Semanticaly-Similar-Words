## Find-Semanticaly-Similar-Words

This repository is for finding the semantically similar words. It gives a word list that are semantically similar to a given word. In this project we also find the word that has a certain similarity to a given word.
It uses Word2vec numerical representations of words, which then can be used to estimate similarity value between the words.
This project uses the word vectors of the 25000 most common English words.

## How to use:
- You can input a word and a similarity measure. The system will then provide a list of similar words that are as much similar to given similarity measure.
- You can input a word and get a list of most similar words and their corresponding similarity measure.
